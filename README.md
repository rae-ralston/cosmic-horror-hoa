## theme: The World is Watching

**Provided Summary:**

You can take this theme as literally as you want or not. Maybe the world itself really is watching. It's been turned into a giant horrifying cosmic horror eyeball. Maybe not so literally... The world may be watching YOU because you're a streamer or major politician. Maybe you're the sole translator for an alien race and everyone is waiting to see what they say. Whatever your ideas for this make them grand, weird, and try something you've never thought of before.
